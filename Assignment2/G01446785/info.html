                            <p>The Computer Science discipline is concerned with the design, analysis, implementation,
                                maintenance, and
                                evolution of computer-based systems, and their associated theoretical foundations.
                                Computer science is
                                powering the information revolution of the 21st century, and computer-based systems are
                                used in every
                                scholarly discipline, every sector of industry, and every walk of human life.</p>
                            <p>
                                Advanced computation tools and techniques are revolutionizing, transforming, and often
                                automating the way we
                                work, play, communicate, collaborate, and conduct business. Computational approaches are
                                integral to a broad
                                array of disciplines including computational natural and social sciences,
                                bioinformatics, health
                                informatics,
                                digital humanities, and financial technology. In addition, the spread of computing
                                throughout society has
                                made
                                the ethical use of computing a central concern to policymakers.</p>

                            <p>Computer scientists must be well-grounded in the theory of computing and in its
                                application to diverse
                                areas,
                                and they must be able to work closely with members of other professions that use
                                computing. The department
                                therefore offers a broad array of programs in computer science at both the undergraduate
                                and graduate
                                levels.
                                Students who study this discipline can learn about a wide variety of concepts and
                                methods in computer
                                science—algorithms, artificial intelligence, computer networking, cyber security,
                                databases, data mining,
                                data
                                structures, machine learning, operating systems, programming languages, robotics,
                                software engineering—and
                                they will explore effective and ethical applications of these concepts and methods.</p>
