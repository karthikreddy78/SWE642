          <p>The Computer Science discipline is concerned with the design, analysis, implementation, maintenance, and
            evolution of computer-based systems, and their associated theoretical foundations. Computer science is
            powering the information revolution of the 21st century, and computer-based systems are used in every
            scholarly discipline, every sector of industry, and every walk of human life.</p>
          <p>
            Advanced computation tools and techniques are revolutionizing, transforming, and often automating the way we
            work, play, communicate, collaborate, and conduct business. Computational approaches are integral to a broad
            array of disciplines including computational natural and social sciences, bioinformatics, health
            informatics,
            digital humanities, and financial technology. In addition, the spread of computing throughout society has
            made
            the ethical use of computing a central concern to policymakers.</p>

          <p>Computer scientists must be well-grounded in the theory of computing and in its application to diverse
            areas,
            and they must be able to work closely with members of other professions that use computing. The department
            therefore offers a broad array of programs in computer science at both the undergraduate and graduate
            levels.
            Students who study this discipline can learn about a wide variety of concepts and methods in computer
            science—algorithms, artificial intelligence, computer networking, cyber security, databases, data mining,
            data
            structures, machine learning, operating systems, programming languages, robotics, software engineering—and
            they will explore effective and ethical applications of these concepts and methods.</p>
