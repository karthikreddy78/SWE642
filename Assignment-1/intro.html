        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Chair's Welcome</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong><strong>Welcome to the Department of Computer Science at George
                Mason University!</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">With nearly 80&nbsp;full-time faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the
            largest department in the <a href="https://cec.gmu.edu">College of Engineering and Computing</a>, one of the
            largest departments on campus, and the largest, fastest growing, and highest ranked Computer
            Science&nbsp;department in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Today, not only is&nbsp;computing pervasive in society, but computational methods
            are used in almost every field of scholarly endeavor ranging from the arts and humanities to the hard
            sciences and engineering, as well as&nbsp;every sector&nbsp;of industry. Given the importance of computing
            in today's world, <strong>we strongly support the goal of <a href="/academics/computing-for-all/">"Computing
                    for All"</a></strong>, providing a diverse array of programs and courses in computing to students
            from all backgrounds and at&nbsp;all levels.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The department offers&nbsp;<a
                href="/prospective-students/undergraduate-programs/">two Bachelor of Science programs</a>&nbsp; with a
            total enrollment of over 2200&nbsp;students:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;the B.S. in Computer Science and the
                inter-disciplinary&nbsp;B.S. in Applied Computer Science; <a
                    href="/prospective-students/ms-programs/">four M.S. programs</a> in Computer Science, Information
                Systems, Information Security and Assurance, and Software Engineering with a total enrollment of almost
                1000 students; and a <a href="/prospective-students/phd-program/">Ph.D. program in Computer Science</a>
                with nearly 200 students. The department's faculty also teach and participate in the inter-disciplinary
                M.S. in Data Analytics Engineering and the Ph.D. in Information Technology offered by the Volgenau
                School of Engineering.</span></p>
        <div>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><span>The department has a <strong><a
                            href="/directory/by-category/faculty">world-class faculty</a>&nbsp;with <a
                            href="/research/">research strengths</a> in all areas of computing, and a strong commitment
                        to teaching</strong>. &nbsp;Nearly half of our faculty were recruited in the past three years,
                    and we now rank among the <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?all&amp;us"><strong>Top 40 Computer
                            Science Departments in the US</strong></a>. &nbsp;Our faculty are engaged in leading edge
                    research in their respective fields and have authored <a href="/research/books-and-software/">widely
                        used textbooks and software.</a> Our faculty's excellence is reflected in the <a
                        href="/about/faculty-awards/">awards</a>&nbsp;we have received for our research (27 NSF CAREER
                    and AFOSR Young Investigator awards, 7 Mason Emerging Researcher awards) and teaching (8 Mason
                    Excellence in Teaching awards), and our faculty include three ACM Fellows and five&nbsp;IEEE
                    Fellows.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><span></span>Several members of the faculty are actively engaged in <a
                    href="/research/campus-collaborations/">inter-disciplinary research collaborations</a> with
                colleagues from all over campus and other universities. Indeed inter-disciplinary collaboration in
                research and education is a key component of our departmental vision and strategic direction for the
                future,</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">The department has an active<a href="/community/advisory-board/">&nbsp;External
                    Advisory Board</a>&nbsp;consisting of industry leaders—many of whom are Mason alumni—who help the
                department build&nbsp;strong ties with <a href="/community/">alumni, local industry, government
                    agencies, and local K-12 schools</a>. The Board members also provide the department with critical
                guidance and feedback so that our courses and programs reflect the state of the art in computing
                technology, thereby helping&nbsp;us with our goal of graduating students that are well prepared to meet
                the workforce needs of the Commonwealth&nbsp;and the nation.&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b>Last but not least, GMU is the largest and most diverse university in
                Virginia and the fastest growing public university in the nation. &nbsp;Correspondingly, the department
                is committed to the <a href="http://vision.gmu.edu">Mason vision </a>of inclusiveness and accessibilty,
                and to efforts that increase the representation of women and underrepresented minority groups in our
                programs and in the field of computing&nbsp;at large.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I invite you to come visit and explore our programs as a current or
                prospective student or faculty member; to partner with us to help provide talented students for your
                company or organization; to keep us informed&nbsp;about&nbsp;your accomplishments as alumni; to explore
                collaborations with us in both research and&nbsp;education; and to make us aware of&nbsp;any new
                initiatives you may like to pursue with us. Please explore our website to learn more about the CS
                Department at Mason!</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Sincerely,</p>
